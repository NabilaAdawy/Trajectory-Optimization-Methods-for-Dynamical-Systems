# Trajectory Optimization Methods for Dynamical Systems

Our goal is to implement a trajectory optimization method with three different techniques to represent the system dynamics. All the mentioned works are based on simulations using Matlab and other tools. In our case, we use CasADi python (CasADi is an open-source framework for nonlinear optimization and algorithmic differentiation) to do our simulations. The solution is obtained using IPOPT (Interior Point Optimizer) solver (which is a class to solve the NLP program). 
The novelty we seek is to compare between the three mentioned techniques, and prove that the number of the decision variables used in the trajectory optimization problem affects on the speed of the solution convergence. The less the number of decision variables the faster the solution converges. This could be useful for dynamical systems with larger DoF such as quadcopter or quadruped. We also combine all the processes, from calculating the optimal trajectory, to designing the appropriate controller to follow this trajectory and then stabilize the system at the desired conditions.
